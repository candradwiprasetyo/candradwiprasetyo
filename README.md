<h1 align="left">Hey what's up?</h1>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

<p align="left">
  ✨ Creating bugs since 2018<br>
  📚 I'm currently diving deeper into advanced UI engineering and accessibility<br>
  🎯 Goals: To build interfaces that are not only functional, but thoughtful and delightful<br>
</p>

<h2 align="left">Philosophy</h2>

<p align="left">
  <em>“If everyone can code, then what makes me different?”</em><br><br>
  Perhaps my strength doesn't just lie in my technical skills, but in how I think.<br><br>
  While others may focus on getting the system to run smoothly, I dive deeper:<br><br>
  - How can I write code that's easy for the team to read and maintain?<br>
  - How can I handle errors gracefully, in a way that respects the user rather than blames them?<br><br>
  I believe great software is not just about functionality it's about empathy. Empathy for the user, and empathy for fellow developers.

<h2 align="left">What I love to build</h2>

<p align="left">
  I’m passionate about crafting visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces. I believe that good design plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience. I strive to ensure that every website I build is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. By prioritizing clean, responsive design and smooth user flows, I aim to create products that are both beautiful and highly effective in meeting user needs.
